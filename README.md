### Below are some images of the app in progess in four screens

![Step One](/images/stepone.png)
This screen demonstrates the initial customer view screen.
Here the customer can order an item (if they already know the item's ID) or view the store's full inventory.

![Step Two](/images/steptwo.png)
This screen displays the user's selection of "view inventory" and displays the inventory in a readable manner.

![Step Three](/images/stepthree.png)
The user is then able to select "purchase an item".  They are prompted to answer questions about what they are buying AND how many.

![Step Four](/images/stepfour.png)
The customer receives information about the new stock quantity for that item AND their price.
